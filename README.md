# homelab_with_ansible

This is example of my own homelab at home. This is based of the ansible cource of Learn Linux TV
Check out the cource at: https://github.com/LearnLinuxTV/getting_started_with_ansible is really good!

This homelab consist of:
- workstations with either ubuntu, Archlinux or POP OS
- Servers with Ubuntu, Debian & CentOS
    - Srv1 = file_server (Ubuntu)
    - Srv2 = db_server (Ubuntu)
    - Srv3 = web_server (Ubuntu)
    - Srv4 = web_server (CentOS)
*Other versions come and go with testing.
