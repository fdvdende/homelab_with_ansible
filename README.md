# homelab_with_ansible

This project has originaly started with the ansible cource of Learn Linux TV
Check out the cource at: https://github.com/LearnLinuxTV/getting_started_with_ansible

Some of the basics are still there but since then I've added allot of different stuff to it.
the majority is inspired by Learn Linux TV personal ansible github which you can find here:
